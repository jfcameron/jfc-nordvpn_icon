handle no internet connection
    - current behaviour is termination due to an unhandled exception

decide when to rebuild country/city data
    1 a user's settings, 2 auth state 3 internet access state all affect the output of countries and cities commands.
    solution: a simple refresh button? call commands on a timer?

handle not authed? 
    - unknown current behaviour but likely unhandled exception.
    could it be handled with the same code i will have to write for no internet?

if no net/no auth, have a refresh button. hide connect/show.
if authed, show connect, disconnect, refresh
